# Maze Solver

The Maze Solver is a Python and Tkinter project that draws a randomized maze and then algorithmically solves the maze.

This is a first attempt. The codebase has much room for improvement and simplification. Whether I return to the project at a later date is uncertain at this point. Most likely it will remain as is.

## Requirements

The app requires Python 3 to run. All development and testing was done using Python `3.11.4`. Other versions may work but have not been tested.

## Running the App

Run the following command in the terminal from the root directory to launch the app:

```shell
% python main.py
```

Exit the app by simply closing the window.

## Tests

A single test was written early in development but broke soon after additional functionality was added. If I return to this project in the future, additional tests will be added and this test fixed.

## Boot.dev

The Maze Solver is a learning exercise I created while working through [Boot.dev](https://boot.dev) coursework. Boot.dev is a great resource for learning backend development. Please check out their courses if you're interested in learning to build similar projects.
